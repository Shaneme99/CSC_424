<p><span style=3D"font-size:1px;">The decision to cut fares of diesel-run b=
uses by Tk 0.03 per kilometre following a fuel price adjustment will benefi=
t the owners only, not the travellers, the Passenger Welfare Association of=
 Bangladesh has said. The association in a statement on Monday described th=
e move to cut the fares as a &ldquo;joke with the nation&rdquo;, saying it =
will not be effective and the bus owners will take the advantage of the oil=
 price cuts. The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority or BRTA recommended th=
e adjustment of bus fares as the government reduced the prices of kerosene =
and diesel by Tk 2.25 per litre for April in line with a monthly readjustme=
nt system. As part of its automatic fuel price coordination, the government=
 reduced the prices in two phases. Diesel price has dropped by a total of T=
k 3 in these phases. The road transport and bridges ministry approved the B=
RTA recommendation and in a notice, it fixed bus and minibus fares on inter=
-district and long routes at Tk 2.12 per kilometre. In Dhaka and Chattogram=
 cities, the fare will be Tk 2.42 per kilometre. The minimum bus and minibu=
s fares in the cities have been kept unchanged at Tk 10 and Tk 8 respective=
ly. The fare on the routes under Dhaka Road Transport Coordination Authorit=
y in Narayanganj, Munshiganj, Narsingdi, Gazipur, Manikganj and Dhaka distr=
ict will be Tk 2.32 a kilometre. Bus fares were revised for the last time i=
n August 2022, when diesel price was cut by Tk 0.05 per litre. At that time=
, long-haul bus fares were cut from Tk 2.20 to Tk 2.15 per kilometre. City =
bus fares dropped from Tk 2.50 to Tk 2.45. The passenger group said the lat=
est fare cut was disproportionate to the fall in diesel price. Its Secretar=
y General Mozammel Haque Chowdhury said the association cannot say how much=
 the fares should be cut because it has not analysed the readjustments, and=
 they no longer are part of the government&rsquo;s cost analysis committee.=
 He alleged the committee&rsquo;s analysis did not appear to be reasonable =
when the association had its representatives in the panel. &ldquo;The decis=
ion won&rsquo;t benefit people. The authorities previously declared to redu=
ce bus fares by Tk 0.02 per kilometre in 2011 and by Tk 0.03 per kilometre =
in 2016, but the bus fares did not decrease.&rdquo; The association also ca=
lled on the government to reduce both the public transport costs and fuel p=
rices by a significant margin considering the affordability of people.</spa=
