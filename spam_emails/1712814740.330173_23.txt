asol consists of three projects: Andasol-1[2] (completed 2008), Andasol-2[5] (completed 2009) and Andasol-3[6] (completed 2011). Each project generates approximately 165 GW-h each per year (a total of 495 GW-h for all three combined),[4] with a gross electricity output of 50 MWe and 49.9 MWe net.[7] This gives the plant a combined power output of 150 MWe. The collectors installed have a combined surface area of 51 hectares (equal to 70 soccer fields); it occupies about 200 ha of land.[7] Andasol is the first parabolic trough power plant in Europe. Because of the high altitude (1,100 m) and the semi-arid climate, the site has exceptionally high annual direct insolation of 2,200 kWh/m2 per year.[7]  Andasol has a thermal storage system which absorbs part of the heat produced in the solar field during the day. This heat is then stored in a molten salt mixture of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate. This process almost doubles the number of operational hours at the solar thermal power plant per year.[8] Each unit fully loaded storage system holds 1,010 MWÂ·ht of heat, enough to run the turbine and produce electricity for about 7.5 hours at full-load, in case of overcast skies or after sunset. The heat reservoirs each consist of two tanks measuring 14 m in height and 36 m in diameter and containing molten salt. Andasol 1 is able to supply environmentally friendly solar electricity for up to 200,000 peo
